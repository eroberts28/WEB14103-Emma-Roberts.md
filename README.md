### Blog Posts

For each lesson throughout the term we had to write up a blog post about a variety of things. These included: our design process for our projects, how our mini lessons went (including working with our team) and also our opinion on theories linked to articles for reading.

### Mini Lessons

I found the mini lessons that we presented were very effective. We got to learn a lot by teaching the rest of the class which I think helped me remember the information a lot easier, but also the interactive discussion when each group presented to us.

### Projects

We also got to complete a few different projects. This was my favourite part as it helped me develop skills in areas that I didn't know much about before. I enjoyed the design aspect of it the most but I also really benefitted from learning from scratch about coding which was great.
